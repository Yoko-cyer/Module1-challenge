# Module 1 Challenge - Refactoring code

## Purpose of this website

I refactored this web site’s code to pass Module 1 challenge for Coding Boot camp in University Western Australia. I have changed things below. 

- I used semantic html tags instead of `<div>` tags on html.
- I added some comments on the CSS file for explanation. 
- I compressed the image size for optimization.
- I added a README file for explanation for this website.
